  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Course Companion started with a group of us, students, deciding that the existing course registration 
    site for the University of Calgary was no longer fitting the requirements of what it was designed for. 
    While the existing software is currently used by all students at the University of Calgary, it is painfully 
    clear that it is in need of a major redesign. My team and I redesigned and reimaged our schedule builder 
    using techniques taught in our HCI class to give a new and fresh approach to register for classes. 

  </p>
  <h4>Project Rationale</h5>
  <p>
    For many students, creating a schedule is an integral part of completing a degree.
    Keeping track of the number of credits, the requirements that have been fulfilled, the courses
    that are offered, and which courses are needed for graduation can be a complicated process
    and many students turn to their Faculty Advisors for help/guidance. The University of
    Calgary has launched an initiative to implement the Course Companion, a tool designed to
    simplify the process of building a schedule and planning courses to help lessen the wait times
    and load on Faculty Advisors, and to streamline and simplify the enrollment process for
    students.
  </p>
  <h5>Expected Types of Users</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Current Students</li>
    <li>Incoming Students</li>
    <li>Excluded Users</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Work Contexts</h5>
  <p>
    Students are required to select courses and build schedules that incorporate classes
    that fulfill requirements for their degree. Each semester, students need to find the list of
    courses offered and check their Academic Requirements in order to check which
    requirements need to be fulfilled and create a schedule using that information. Students may
    also contact a faculty advisor to help plan their semester. This is done every semester until a
    student completes their degree and graduates.
  </p>
  <h5>Concrete Task Examples</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Task Example #1: Mariam</li>
    <p>
        Mariam is a fourth year student at the University of Calgary. She has nearly
        completed her bachelor's degree, and has 10 courses remaining. In order to create a
        schedule that will fill her requirements, Mariam opens the Academic Advisor page on
        her Student Centre and checks which requirements have not been fulfilled yet, and
        what classes can fulfill those requirements by comparing it to the classes offered
        during the year. She then adds the classes that do not overlap with one another and
        complete her requirements. She creates a Fall and Winter schedule for the upcoming
        year that fulfill her requirements for graduation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mariam is a typical user of the system. There are always students that are
        graduating each year, so this is infrequent for most users, but a routine task
        and important task regardless. Being at the end of your degree is when it is
        most important that you have all of your qualifications to graduate.
    </p>
    <li>Task Example #2: Olivia </li>
    <p>
        Olivia is a third year student at the University of Calgary and is about to start
        the course registration process for the next Winter semester. To build her class
        schedule, Olivia starts by reviewing her required courses and goes to add ones she has
        not done yet into the schedule builder. Then, she checks the time of each class and
        tutorial to make sure there are no conflicts and makes any necessary adjustments.
        However, when she tries to enter a class with a full waitlist, she has to manually check
        if the waitlist is open every few hours. Eventually, she is able to get onto the waitlist
        and finalizes her schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        Olivia is a typical user of the system. Her task is routine and important. In a
        student’s third year, they are typically planning for their last two remaining
        years. Many students are not aware that there are a limited number of 200
        level courses they need to take, and should be made aware of this during their
        last few years in their degree, so that they can graduate on time.
    </p>
    <li>Task Example #3: Benjamin</li>
    <p>
        Benjamin is a recent graduate from the United States who just moved to
        Calgary to pursue an undergraduate in Computer Science at the University of Calgary.
        He goes to the University’s online schedule builder and starts planning his first Fall
        semester. To figure out which classes he needs to take, Benjamin finds a list of
        required classes for his major. He looks at the requirements for the first year of the
        degree, and he notes CPSC 231. He checks if there are any prerequisites and if it’s
        being offered in Fall. Once he confirms that he is eligible, he adds it to his schedule.
        He repeats the same steps for two more courses. Eventually he is able to finalize his
        schedule with CPSC 231, MATH 211, and PHIL 279.
    </p>
    <p>
        Benjamin is a typical user performing a routine and important task. New
        students come in every year, and with that they are the most important to
        educate with the schedule planning system. Many questions they ask are very
        simple, and can easily be answered if the information was easier to access.
    </p>
    <li>Task Example #4: Wayne</li>
    <p>
        Wayne is in his 3rd year pursuing a Business degree, with a minor in
        Computer Science. He plans his upcoming year for both Fall and Winter. He begins
        by planning for Fall. He finds a course calendar that outlines what he needs for each
        Business concentration, along with descriptions of each course contained in them. He
        already knows that he needs to take CPSC 319, so he immediately adds it to his
        schedule. He then looks for courses to take in Business Technology Management, and
        notes BTMA 331 and BTMA 333. After reading the descriptions, he decides to take
        BTMA 331. Afterwards, he looks for Computer Science classes, and remembers that
        PHIL 279 was not offered in the Winter last year, so tries to see if he can take it this
        upcoming year. He finds that it is being offered in the Fall and adds it to his schedule.
        He checks to see what other courses interest him in Computer Science, and adds
        CPSC 329 to his schedule as well. Afterwards, he finalizes his schedule and enrolls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wayne is not the typical user, but his task is infrequent and important.
        Business majors are required to declare a concentration by graduation. In
        addition, most students are not taking minors but these additional courses must
        be considered as well. 
    </p>
    <li>Task Example #5: Azhar</li>
    <p>
        Azhar, a fourth-year student at the University of Calgary, is currently enrolled
        in the Faculty of Science and pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
        Science. During his course planning for the upcoming term, he became interested in
        two courses offered by the Software Engineering and Computer Science departments,
        respectively. The courses in question were SENG 511, offered by the Software
        Engineering department, and CPSC 599, a special topic course offered by the
        Computer Science department.</br>
        When attempting to enroll in these courses using the Schedule Builder, Azhar
        encountered a warning that indicated that he needed to obtain permission from an
        academic advisor. As a result, he sent an email to the Faculty of Science Student
        Centre to request an appointment with an academic advisor. After scheduling an
        appointment and meeting with the academic advisor, Azhar received the necessary
        permission to enroll in the courses of his interest.

    </p>
    <p>
        Azhar is a typical user, along with performing an infrequent but important task. Some
        Software Engineering courses require Computer Science students to manually request
        permission for enrollment. It is important that students are made aware of this
        information as soon as possible. As a result, Azhar illustrates many qualities of our
        expected user.
    </p>
    <li>Task Example #6: Anna</li>
    <p>
        Anna is a first year Natural Science major at the University of Calgary. She
        has recently been accepted to transfer into a Combined Degree of Biology and
        Computer Science for Fall 2023. In order to create a schedule for the coming year that
        will fulfill requirements for the degree she transferred into, she searches for the
        first-year degree guide for both the Computer Science and Biology programs and
        looks at the suggested courses for each program. She creates a schedule by using that
        as a guide for selecting courses, adding them into the Schedule Builder, and checking
        each class for any potential time conflicts. She creates a schedule for the upcoming
        year that fulfills her requirements for the upcoming year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anna is another typical user of the system, with the only caveat being that she has
        transferred into a combined degree. Hence, her task is infrequent but important. This
        means that her required courses and graduation requirements have been changed, so
        she will need to adjust which courses she plans for in the future, which is not a routine
        that most students must go through.
    </p>
  </ol>
  <p><i>Each task example was collected through interviews of typical users of the Schedule Builder
    system. Some were recorded sessions, others were live demos of putting the user in a
    hypothetical situation, and watching them plan their courses. Tasks were validated by asking
    the users after the task descriptions were formed, and confirming if these were faithful to
    their experiences.</i></p>

  <h5>Requirements List</h5>
  <img src="../pictures/ccRequirementsList.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

  <ul>
    <li>Must Include:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Each item in this list is essential to the core functions of our system, from the
            task descriptions we saw that students always needed to reference an external
            source to check the appropriate information when planning their schedule.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Should Include:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Helpful to students to see a high level overview in terms of their degree
            progress (especially if they are close to graduation) but not essential.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Could Include:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The waitlist is a regular grievance with Schedule Builder. But part/full-time
            status is a smaller detail that a student can easily miss, especially if they are
            new. These non-essential features fall under “nice to haves” as they do not
            target the goal of the new system.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Exclude:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Actual enrollment is still handled by Schedule Builder, so it must integrate
            with Schedule Builder’s backend. This also means we also cannot export any
            data to semesters that Schedule Builder does not present. Most students rarely
            looked at courses outside of their faculty, so when filtering courses and
            sorting, we chose not to inherently suggest courses outside of a student’s
            graduation requirements (not including eligible open options).
            </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h5>Redesigning</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>The first element of our prototype we redesigned is we added the ability for users to plan for
      two semesters at the same time.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>The reason for this change is because in our first
        prototype, users were only able to create a schedule for one semester at a time. If the
        users wanted to navigate to another semester, there was a button on the right with an
        arrow that indicated the next semester they could plan. In redesigning the prototype,
        we wanted to simplify the process of creating a schedule, and took into consideration
        the fact that most students plan multiple semesters at a time.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>The way in which we simplify the process is we redesigned our
        prototype to show two semesters at a time, ex. Fall and Winter, so students would
        have the ability to plan for and visualise both.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>By changing the view from one semester at a time to two
        semesters at a time, the user does not need to navigate back and forth between
        semesters and thus does not get confused by accidentally doubling up on classes and
        has a better picture for the year ahead.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>This benefits the users as it allows for users to change
        and finalise their schedules for two semesters -one academic year- at the same time.
        This prevents the need for users to continuously navigate back and forth across
        semesters and to break up the space, we added a background colour behind each
        semester, which makes it easier for users to visualise which classes are currently
        planned for which semester.</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>The user could get confused and mix up which current
        semester a class is offered in. The user could accidentally add a class to one semester
        instead of the other. The user could have confusions in navigating between semesters.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We also considered a tab option in which you could
        choose the tab corresponding to the semester of your choice. This would prevent
        visually seeing the user’s schedule simultaneously and also is quite similar to
        schedule builder.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Another element we redesigned was the way courses were filtered. In our first prototype, we
      had a drop-down menu above the display where users could check and apply filters. In our
      redesign, we moved the filters to the left of the screen.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>The reason for the change is to take a step back from
        schedule builder and to not overwhelm the user. Having so much information at once
        can overwhelm the user so they are unable to focus on the important part, which is
        choosing their courses.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>We changed from a drop down list view to a sidebar menu of
        options with course suggestions based on those options.</li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>This way the user can clearly see the options selected as
        well as the course suggested, whereas in the previous design all of the information
        was overlapped and hard to see.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>The benefits of this choice are more spread out
        information so that the user is not overwhelmed, options not layered over one another
        so that the user can clearly see all the information, we have more options for filtering
        which makes course selection/browsing easier and cleaner setup with clearer semester
        planning.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>Users may think that the courses that are being
        suggested are the courses they have added to semester cart/enrollment.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We considered a button that would refresh new
        courses instead of a slider bar but a slider bar makes more sense because it is very
        common in other applications that the user might be familiar with.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>The third element we redesigned was that we incorporated more filters for users, such as the
      ability to filter based on the level of the course, and eligibility.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>The reason for this change is that users may want to
        filter beyond just their requirements, they may want to filter more precisely, for
        example a 200 level open option course.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>The change that was made was we incorporated more options for
        users to choose from, which allows for users to easily see and click the available
        filtering options.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>By including more available options to filter by, it allows
        easier navigation and simplifies the process of filtering.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>This redesign can benefit the users by providing more
        options for users to filter by.</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>A downside might be that users could be confused by
        the many filtering options that are provided since graduation requirements are not
        clearly communicated to students.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We had no other considerations for this change.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Another element we redesigned we added the units for each semester are shown in button
      corner of the semester they are planned for
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>Original prototype did not have a way to see the credits
        that would be applied to the proposed/planned semester.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong> The change we made was to add a units option that is shown at
        the bottom of each semester.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>The change addresses the reason by showing the
        prospective credits that would be achieved for a given semester with the courses
        currently in each semester.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>The benefits for this choice are that the user can easily
        see how many units/credits are acquired for a given semester. The user has clarity on
        how units/credits work (especially helpful for first year students).</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>Users may become confused at the concept of
        units/credits.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We had no other considerations for this change.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Added a reset button.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>A user may wish to reset their entire schedule and start
        from scratch. Doing this by removing class by class could get tedious.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>We added a reset button to the bottom of the page.</li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>: The change addresses the reason because by pressing the
        button, a user can remove all the classes that they had previously added and are able
        to start from scratch.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>Users are able to easily locate the button and use it to
        reset their schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>Users may accidentally press the button because it is
        next to the export button. Users may think that the button is for something else and
        press it without realizing what this does.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We had no other considerations for this issue
        presently.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Added a confirmation screen when users export to schedule builder
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>After the export button is pressed, a user may wonder if
        the export was successful and if their schedule is now inputted into schedule builder.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>We made a confirmation screen that appears after the button is
        pressed and the export is confirmed.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>The confirmation screen confirms that the schedule was
        successfully exported and the user is free to leave Course Companion to go to
        schedule builder.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>This benefits the user by getting rid of any confusion
        about whether or not the export was successful and therefore limits frustration and
        worry in regards to safely leaving Course Companion.</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>Users may think that the confirmation screen means
        that they are enrolled in their courses.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We have no other considerations at this time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Added help, contact buttons
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>This change helps improve user experience by providing
        users with easy access to support and assistance.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>We added a “Help" button and a “add” button on the bottom left
        corner of the screen.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>The change addresses the reason by improving the user
        experience by providing users easy access to support and assistance when run into
        problems or have any questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>Users can now easily get help, it improves the overall
        user experience and gives them a tour of the interface.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>They are very small and easy to mistake for copyright
        text. They do not look like buttons. They are not at the bottom of the screen and
        centered which is the usual place for help and contact buttons.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We have no other consideration for this change.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Redesign the way course information is seen by user, it is now a little drop down button to see
      info
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong> In the previous sketch, the expanded course information
        had an overwhelming amount of information that would not be used by the users.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>We changed the design so that the information was hidden
        behind a little dropdown because the course information is not important for the user
        if they are looking for a specific class or if they are just browsing for a topic that
        interests them.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>This new design allows users to press the dropdown
        button to provide additional information, and does not overwhelm the user with the
        condensed information.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>The user is familiar with the schedule builder dropdown
        design. The user is not overwhelmed with unnecessary information. The user can
        view more courses because there is more space to view more courses.</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>The user may miss the dropdown and not see the
        hidden information.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We considered not having additional information at
        all but decided it was important and necessary to have. We also considered having a
        popup box instead of a dropdown but the dropdown was the better option because
        closing infinite pop ups can get tedious and annoying.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      Original “Add” button and checkboxes removed, changed to a uniform + button.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reason For Change: </strong>The check box was unclear because it was difficult to
        see how many courses were selected and if it was a selection to add the course or if it
        was a selection for something else.
        </li>
      <li><strong>Change Made: </strong>We changed the check box to a plus add button at the top right
        corner of each course that is suggested.</li>
      <li><strong>Addresses Reason: </strong>The plus add button is green and very clear that it is an
        addition button to add a specific course to a semester.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefits of Choice: </strong>The user can clearly see that the plus button means add a
        course to the user’s semester schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Downsides of Choice: </strong>Users could think that the plus means additional
        information.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Considerations: </strong>We did not have any additional considerations aside
        from the idea of using checkboxes instead of the plus symbol.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <h4>Final Design Rational</h4>
  <h5>State of Design</h5>
  <p>The system we designed is a course planner that simplifies the process of creating a
    schedule and planning classes by providing users with a way to select courses based on their
    requirements. Instead of individually searching for a class that fulfills a credit, the system takes
    into consideration each student's major and progress to show users courses that they should
    take. Users are able to search for specific classes, and see which requirements a class would fill
    and see how their planned schedule would impact their progress to degree completion.
  </p>
  <h5>What Works Well</h5>
  <p>
    An element of our system that works well is the ability for users to search for specific
    classes. The search can be utilized to find courses based on the semester they are offered, the
    level of the course and the title of the course. This feature allows users to easily find a specific
    class or classes with certain criteria to add to their schedule, such as searching for 500 level
    CPSC classes.</br>
    The filter feature on our system allows users to filter the suggested courses based on
    various conditions such as major field requirements, open options, and eligible courses among
    others, which simplifies the process of finding and selecting a course to fulfill a specific
    requirement. The filter simplifies the process by only showing users courses that they want to
    see, which prevents the users from needing to sift through irrelevant courses to find what they
    are looking for.</br>
    Our system is designed such that users can create a schedule and plan for multiple
    semesters at once. This feature was incorporated into our design plan, as it is a frequently
    occurring task and more often than not students are planning for multiple semesters. The ability
    to plan for multiple semesters at once reduces confusion, as users do not need to shift across
    multiple pages to plan their courses for the year. </br>
    Users are able to view their progress in their degree using the progress bar. Users can
    also see what their proposed schedule would mean for their progress, which allows users to
    plan their courses accordingly. This feature also simplifies the process because users do not
    need to go back and forth between multiple pages to add courses and check their requirements.

  </p>
  <h5>What Still Needs Improvement</h5>
  <p>
    A few improvements that can be done to our design is to add a degree requirements
    checklist, that checks off classes that have already been taken. This makes it clear to users
    which classes they have taken and which requirements have been fulfilled. Another
    improvement is to include highlights in the help tutorial that starts when a user clicks the help
    button. Highlighting each section that the help tutorial is explaining can add some clarity for
    users.
  </p>
  <h5>Would Our System Work Well for Identified Users and Tasks</h5>
  <p>The identified users for the course planning system are current and incoming students.
    Overall, the system would work well for identified users of the system and the tasks because
    users would be able to complete tasks like creating a schedule and searching for classes that fill
    requirements in a way that's simpler by utilizing features like the filter and the degree progress
    bar. The system we designed takes each student's degree, and progression into account and
    provides a planner where students can easily access that information while creating their
    schedule. The system also provides real time updates on how each proposed schedule would
    impact a students progression -which is reflected in the progress bar- and keeps students
    informed on their progress and doesn’t require them to utilize multiple resources to select
    classes that fulfill degree requirements.</br>
    The task identified through task walkthroughs and examples included looking for courses
    that fulfill a requirement, creating a schedule in conjunction with other resources to ensure that
    requirements are filled, which our system covers.

  </p>
  <h5>Design Strengths</h5>
  <p>
    A strong design element of our system is the degree progress bar. This progress bar
    allows users to easily access their degree requirements and see how far along in their degree
    they are. It also shows users how many credits of each requirement they have filled, and how
    many they have left, which users can utilize to make informed decisions about their schedules
    such that they fulfill any missing requirements. The search where users can see all courses that
    match the search, and select which ones they want. The simplicity of the design makes it so
    users are not overwhelmed with information, and can simply filter courses and choose what they
    want. The design also allows for a simple way to add and remove classes and see any
    ineligibilities as soon as someone tries to add a course they can’t enroll in. This all makes
    planning courses a simpler task.
  </p>
  <h5>Design Weaknesses</h5>
  <p>
    Our system design has a few weaknesses, one being that users are not able to see the
    time that each class is offered. This can make it difficult to plan courses for specific times or to
    see if any courses have time conflicts. Another weakness is that users can’t see course details
    like what time the course is offered, the number of seats, if the course is open or at capacity or
    offers a waitlist. This can also be an obstacle as users may create an entire schedule and only
    once it's been exported to schedule builder will they notice these issues, causing them to rethink
    their course choices.That system also can not handle block week courses currently. Lastly,
    users are not able to view the form in which the class is being delivered, whether it is online or
    in-person which for some users can be an important factor in whether they want to register for
    the class.
