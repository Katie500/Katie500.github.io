  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Elemental Endeavor is a strategic online game that combines the classic gameplay of Tic Tac Toe with elemental powers - 
    Fire, Water, and Earth. Developed as part of the SENG 513 course on October 31, 2023, for Assignment 3, this game challenges 
    players to think strategically and outsmart their opponents in a 5x5 grid.
  </p>
  <h5>Gameplay</h5>
    <h6>Objective:</h6>
    <p>The goal of Elemental Endeavor is to be the first player to connect three of their own elemental tokens in a row, either 
        horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    </p>

    <h6>Elements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire üî•</li>
        <li>Water üíß</li>
        <li>Earth üåç</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Game Setup:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>The game uses a 5x5 grid, similar to Tic Tac Toe.</li>
        <li>Each player has a set of elemental options: Fire, Water, and Earth. Each element has a unique symbol.</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>Player Elements:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Player 1 is represented by the element Fire (üî•).</li>
        <li>Player 2 is represented by the element Water (üíß).</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Gameplay Rules:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Players take turns placing their elemental tokens on an empty space in the grid.</li>
        <li>Each player's elemental token is visually represented by a symbol corresponding to their chosen element.</li>
        <li>A player can replace an opponent's token with their own if their token defeats the opponent's token based on the elemental 
            interactions.
        </li>
        <li>Players cannot play on a space that was played upon in the previous round.</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>Elemental Interactions:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire üî• beats Earth üåç.</li>
        <li>Earth üåç beats Water üíß.</li>
        <li>Water üíß beats Fire üî•.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Winning the Game:</h6>
    <p>The first player to connect three of their own elemental tokens in a row wins the game. Elemental tokens can form winning 
        combinations horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    </p>

    <h6>Game Controls:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the "Select Your Element" buttons to choose between Fire, Water, and Earth.</li>
        <li>Click on the cells of the 5x5 grid to place your elemental token.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Modal Instructions:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the "Instructions" button to view the game instructions in a modal.</li>
        <li>The modal provides setup details, gameplay rules, elemental interactions, and winning conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Winner Modal:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>When a player wins, a modal appears announcing the winner.</li>
        <li>The modal displays the winning player and provides an option to exit the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Exit Button:</h6>
    <p>Clicking the "Exit" button in the winner modal clears the board and resets the game, returning to Player 1's turn.</p>

    <h6>Notes:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>The game incorporates a unique algorithm to handle elemental interactions and prevent infinite loops in token placement.</li>
        <li>Players can only place tokens on empty spaces and strategically replace opponents' tokens based on the strengths and weaknesses of 
        the elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
