  <h5>PLANET UNLOCK LINK</h5>

  <a href="https://github.com/SimonRVincent/lock-screen">View Source Code!</a>

  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Our primary goal for this project was to design and implement a gesture  
    unlock scenario that was secure, creative, and fun! In pursuit of this 
    objective, we designed an unlock method by use of a solar system and game  
    display that allows a user to unlock their phone by selecting planets
    in a particular order predefined by the user. This creative method of  
    unlocking your phone is not only creative but also entertaining and 
    fun.</p>

  <h5>Interface Logic</h5>
  <p>The "Planetary Combination Unlock Interface" operates as an innovative and
    engaging unlocking mechanism for mobile devices. Upon the initial setup, 
    the user selects a unique combination of planets in a specific order, creating 
    a personalized unlocking sequence. The interface background features a display of
    nine planets, and the user's preset combination dictates the particular sequence in
    which the planets must be selected to unlock the device.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the interface works:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Initialization: When the mobile device screen is activated, the user is presented 
      with the interface's planetary background, displaying all nine planets in a visually 
      appealing arrangement.</li>
    <li>User Interaction: The user must interact with the interface by tapping on the planets
      in the correct predetermined order. This interaction relies on the user's prior setup of 
      the specific planet sequence required for unlocking.</li>
    <li>Input Validation: As the user taps on each planet, the interface verifies whether the
      selection corresponds to the preset sequence. If the selected planet aligns with the predetermined
      next planet in the sequence, the interface provides visual feedback to indicate successful recognition.</li>
    <li>Error Handling: In the event of an incorrect planet selection, the interface does not provide audio
      feedback indicating the recognition of the erroneous input. This approach ensures that accidental taps 
      or incorrect sequences do not trigger any indication of progress toward unlocking the device.</li>
    <li>Completion and Unlocking: Once the user successfully selects all the planets in the correct order, 
      the interface initiates a final animation or transition, symbolizing the completion of the unlocking 
      process. This animation serves as a conclusive confirmation that the correct sequence has been followed, 
      leading to the device's successful unlocking.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    By implementing this intuitive and secure unlocking mechanism, the Planetary Combination Interface 
    emphasizes the importance of user-specific sequences while integrating engaging visual and auditory feedback to 
    enhance the overall user experience. Additionally, the interface's stringent error handling mechanisms 
    reinforce the necessity of accuracy and precision in executing the designated unlocking sequence.
  </p>

  <h5>Initial 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>Each team member was asked to sketch out 10 ideas that they 
    believe could be suitable for an innovative and engaging unlock 
    application.</p>

  <h5>Refined 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>After agreeing that the "Planet Unlock" idea had the most prospect 
    for creativity and success, each team member created 10 refined 
    sketches that matched their vision of the game. We then discussed 
    all the designs, and decided on the game layout and the feasible 
    features that could be implemented given our timeline. Here are 
    a subset of sketches that were done during that time. </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Unique Planets: Users can name their own planets for unlocking their phone.</li>
    <li>Swipe Universe: Users can swipe to connet all their planets together.</li>
    <li>Choose the order: Users can choose the order of their planets for the passcode and display.</li>
    <li>Stars: Users can integrate stars in place of planets or for added security features.</li>
    <li>Custom Look: Users can create a custom look to planets to change their size, shape, color, or design as well as adding moons or rings.</li>
    <li>Info Planets: Users can create special and unique facts about their planets.</li>
    <li>Spaceship Tap: When a user taps a planet, a space ship travels to where the user tapped.</li>
    <li>Add Aliens to Planets: Users can add a cute little alien to their planet.</li>
    <li>Exploding Planets: If I user gets a password wrong, all planets explode in a cool animation.</li>
    <li>Design Your Astronaut: Users can make their own astronaut avatar.</li>
  </ol>
  

  <h5>What makes our creative unlock special?</h5>
  <p>The Planetary Combination Interface stands out due to its unique blend of several distinctive features, making it a creative alternative to conventional unlocking methods. 
    Some of the key aspects that makes this interface special include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Personalized Security: Unlike standard unlock patterns or PIN codes, the Planetary Combination Interface allows users to create a personalized unlocking sequence based on their chosen planetary order. 
      This personalized approach adds an extra layer of security, as the unlocking process becomes highly specific to the individual user.</li>
    <li>Engaging Visual Experience: The interface employs a visually captivating display of planetary objects, offering an aesthetically pleasing and engaging backdrop for the unlocking process. 
      The interactive animations and auditory feedback provide an immersive and enjoyable user experience, making the unlocking process more than just a security checkpoint but an engaging interaction.</li>
    <li>Intuitive Feedback Mechanism: Through its responsive feedback system, the interface offers real-time visual and auditory feedback that confirms the recognition of the user's input. This assures users
      that their actions are being acknowledged and processed by the system.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Overall, the Planetary Combination Interface distinguishes itself through its fusion of personalization, engagement, and security, offering users a novel and captivating unlocking experience that goes beyond the standard 'slide to unlock' approach.
  </p>

  <h5>Project contribution:</h5>
  <p>Our team's success was largely due to the organization and effort 
    of Simon. Are most valued ideas and sketches came from both Simon and Katie. 
    Our gesture unlock was brilliantly designed by Simon and coded by Katie, while our congratulations 
    screen and choose methods screens were created by Katie. Nayera and Hala filmed our demo video 
    and Nayera put together some sections of the write up.</p>
