          Ahmose I, an influential Egyptian pharaoh, reigned during the 
          New Kingdom's early 18th Dynasty, around 1550–1525 BCE. He 
          played a pivotal role in the expulsion of the Hyksos, a foreign 
          group that had controlled parts of Egypt for several decades. 
          Ahmose I's military campaigns successfully liberated the Nile 
          Delta and the rest of Egypt, marking the end of the Second 
          Intermediate Period. His reign initiated the New Kingdom's era 
          of prosperity and expansion, characterized by significant 
          cultural and architectural advancements. Ahmose I is also 
          renowned for consolidating power, restoring traditional Egyptian 
          religious practices, and establishing a stable foundation for 
          future pharaohs. His contributions laid the groundwork for the 
          greatness of the New Kingdom, which would include the illustrious 
          reigns of subsequent pharaohs like Thutmose III and Ramesses II.

          for his military exploits and efforts to expand the Egyptian empire. 
          Thutmose I conducted successful military campaigns in Nubia,

          Thutmose II, the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty in ancient Egypt, reigned from around 1493 to 1479 BCE. He was the son of Thutmose I and married his half-sister, Hatshepsut, who later became one of Egypt's most famous pharaohs. Thutmose II's rule was relatively short, and he is often overshadowed by the accomplishments of his wife. Nevertheless, he continued military campaigns in Nubia, maintaining Egyptian control over the southern territories. His premature death led to a succession crisis, eventually resulting in Hatshepsut assuming the role of regent for Thutmose III, the young heir to the throne. Thutmose II's reign is significant for its transitional nature, setting the stage for the remarkable era that followed under the joint rule of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.

          Hatshepsut, one of the most notable pharaohs of ancient Egypt, reigned from around 1479 to 1458 BCE during the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom. She is particularly renowned for breaking with tradition and assuming the full powers of a pharaoh, a role typically reserved for men. Initially serving as regent for her stepson, Thutmose III, Hatshepsut gradually took on the responsibilities of kingship and eventually declared herself pharaoh. During her rule, Egypt experienced a period of prosperity marked by extensive trade, artistic and architectural achievements, including the construction of the famous temple at Deir el-Bahari. Hatshepsut's reign was a time of relative peace, and she is remembered as one of the most successful and influential pharaohs in ancient Egyptian history. However, her legacy faced some attempts at erasure after her death, likely due to the unconventional nature of her rule, but modern archaeology and historical research have restored her to a well-deserved place of prominence in Egyptian history.

Initially overshadowed by his stepmother and co-regent, Hatshepsut, Thutmose III assumed sole rule after her death. He is widely recognized for his military prowess, conducting numerous successful campaigns that expanded the Egyptian empire to its greatest territorial extent. The Battle of Megiddo in 1457 BCE is particularly famous, earning Thutmose III a reputation as a brilliant strategist. Despite his military focus, Thutmose III also contributed to the cultural and architectural development of Egypt, sponsoring construction projects and overseeing the building of temples. His reign is considered a high point in ancient Egyptian history, marking the zenith of the New Kingdom. Thutmose III's efforts in both military and cultural spheres left an enduring legacy, and he is remembered as one of Egypt's most accomplished pharaohs.

His reign is characterized by both military achievements and cultural developments, with a particular emphasis on athletic activities and the promotion of a martial image.

His reign is notable for a famous dream stela located between the paws of the Sphinx at Giza, in which he claimed that the Sphinx had promised him the throne if he cleared the sand covering its body. Thutmose IV is credited with restoring the Sphinx and, as a result, he is sometimes referred to as the "Sphinx Pharaoh." Despite the focus on the Sphinx, Thutmose IV's reign is generally considered less militarily active compared to his predecessors. He engaged in some campaigns in Nubia and the Levant, but his reign is marked more by diplomatic efforts and internal development. Thutmose IV's son, Amenhotep III, would later ascend to the throne and preside over a period of great prosperity and artistic achievement in ancient Egypt.

          and is located between the paws of the Great Sphinx of Giza, one of Egypt's most prominent landmarks. 
          The stele details a story of Thutmose IV as a prince who falls asleep and dreams that the god Harmachis gives 
          him a promise that he will ascend the throne. This is a very interesting piece because it details the power in the 
          beliefs of the ancient Egyptian gods. We could infer that this stele was used as a propaganda piece to secure 
          Thutmose IV's place on the throne and show the power he holds because he was "chosen by the gods" in a dream.

His reign is often regarded as a time of unprecedented prosperity, peace, and cultural flourishing. Amenhotep III's reign saw remarkable artistic and architectural achievements, with a particular emphasis on grand construction projects and the development of a distinct artistic style. The pharaoh commissioned the construction of numerous temples, statues, and monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon and the Luxor Temple. He engaged in extensive diplomatic relations and trade, maintaining stable international relations and accumulating vast wealth. The reign of Amenhotep III is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Egypt," reflecting the wealth and cultural richness of this period. His son, Akhenaten, would later succeed him and bring about significant religious and cultural changes in ancient Egypt.

          Akhenaten, originally known as Amenhotep IV, was the tenth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, ruling over ancient Egypt from around 1353 to 1336 BCE during the New Kingdom period. He is perhaps best known for his religious reforms, notably the promotion of Aten, the sun disc, as the sole deity to be worshipped. This marked a departure from the traditional polytheistic religious beliefs of ancient Egypt. Akhenaten moved the capital from Thebes to a new city called Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), emphasizing the shift in religious focus.
          </br>
          Akhenaten's reign had profound effects on Egyptian art, introducing a more naturalistic and expressive style. The depiction of the pharaoh and the royal family became more intimate and less formal. Nefertiti, Akhenaten's wife, played a prominent role in both the religious and artistic changes.
          </br>
          Despite the initial enthusiasm for the Aten cult, Akhenaten's reforms faced resistance, and after his death, traditional religious practices were reinstated. His successor, Tutankhamun (formerly Tutankhaten), reversed the religious reforms and restored the worship of traditional deities. Akhenaten's legacy is complex, remembered both for his revolutionary religious ideas and the subsequent rejection of his reforms by later pharaohs.

          Smenkhkare is a historical figure from ancient Egypt who reigned during the tumultuous period known as the Amarna Period, around the mid-14th century BCE. There is some uncertainty and mystery surrounding Smenkhkare's identity and the exact nature of his rule. He is often considered a successor or co-regent of Akhenaten and may have been a brother or close relative.
          </br>
          Smenkhkare's reign is thought to have been brief, possibly lasting for only a few years. He is associated with the religious changes initiated by Akhenaten, continuing the worship of the sun disc Aten. Some theories propose that Smenkhkare and Nefertiti, Akhenaten's queen, may have co-ruled for a time. The historical records are fragmented, and much about Smenkhkare's role, relationships, and the circumstances of his rule remains unclear. His reign is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate and investigation within the field of Egyptology.

          Neferneferuaten is a royal name associated with the Amarna Period of ancient Egypt, particularly during the reign of Akhenaten and the subsequent period of religious reforms. The name is most notably linked to a female ruler, often suggested to be Queen Nefertiti or possibly another wife or relative of Akhenaten.
          </br>
          Neferneferuaten's identity is a subject of scholarly debate and uncertainty. Some theories propose that Neferneferuaten may have been an epithet or an alternative name for Nefertiti, who was a prominent queen during the Amarna Period. Others suggest that Neferneferuaten might have been an individual distinct from Nefertiti, perhaps a daughter or another wife of Akhenaten.
          </br>
          The historical records from this period are fragmented and incomplete, contributing to the ambiguity surrounding Neferneferuaten's identity. The mystery of this ruler and the relationships within the royal family during the Amarna Period continues to be a topic of exploration and discussion among Egyptologists.

          Tutankhamun, often colloquially referred to as "King Tut," was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty who reigned from around 1332 to 1323 BCE during the New Kingdom period. He ascended to the throne at a very young age, possibly around nine or ten years old. Tutankhamun is most famous for the intact burial of his tomb, discovered by Howard Carter in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. The discovery of the tomb was a monumental event in archaeology, as it provided an unprecedented glimpse into the funerary practices, art, and artifacts of ancient Egypt.
          </br>Tutankhamun's reign was relatively short, and he is believed to have died around the age of 18. His parentage remains a subject of debate, but he is commonly thought to be the son of Akhenaten and one of his sisters. During his reign, Tutankhamun reversed the religious reforms instituted by his predecessor Akhenaten, restoring the worship of traditional Egyptian gods.
          </br>While Tutankhamun's historical significance during his lifetime may have been limited, the discovery of his tomb and its treasures has made him one of the most famous pharaohs in popular culture. The artifacts from his burial, including the iconic golden death mask, have become symbols of ancient Egypt's wealth and artistic achievement.

After Tutankhamun's death, Ay succeeded him as pharaoh, ruling from around 1323 to 1319 BCE.
          <br>Ay's reign was relatively short, and during his time, he worked to undo the religious reforms of Akhenaten and return Egypt to traditional polytheistic beliefs.

          Horemheb, the last pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty, ruled over ancient Egypt from around 1319 to 1292 BCE. Before ascending to the throne, Horemheb served in the military under Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, and Ay. His military career played a crucial role in the political landscape of the time, and he rose to the position of commander-in-chief of the army.
          <br>Horemheb came to power after Ay, and his reign marked a return to traditional Egyptian religious practices and political stability. He undertook extensive building projects, including the completion of the temple at Karnak, and worked to restore monuments that had been defaced during Akhenaten's religious reforms.
          <br>Horemheb's efforts helped stabilize the country and set the stage for the subsequent 19th Dynasty. He had no direct heir, and after his death, the throne passed to Ramesses I, marking the beginning of a new era in ancient Egyptian history. Horemheb's reign is often seen as a period of restoration and recovery after the challenges faced during the Amarna Period.

The 19th Dynasty, which began with Ramesses I, played a crucial role in shaping the history and power of ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period.

          Ramesses II, commonly known as Ramesses the Great, was the third pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty and one of the most powerful and influential rulers in ancient Egypt. He reigned for an exceptionally long period, from around 1279 to 1213 BCE during the New Kingdom period. Ramesses II was the son of Seti I and Queen Tuya.
          <br>His reign is often characterized by military campaigns, monumental building projects, and diplomatic endeavors. Ramesses II engaged in military expeditions against the Hittites, most notably at the Battle of Kadesh, a conflict that ended in a stalemate but was later commemorated through inscriptions and reliefs that exaggerated the pharaoh's achievements. Despite the lack of a clear victory, the peace treaty that followed marked diplomatic success and established a lasting peace between Egypt and the Hittite Empire.
          <br>Ramesses II is perhaps best known for his ambitious construction projects, including the construction of the Ramesseum and the temples at Abu Simbel. The latter features colossal statues of Ramesses II carved into the rock facade. His numerous monuments and inscriptions aimed to glorify his reign and emphasize his military prowess.
          <br>In addition to his military and architectural achievements, Ramesses II is believed to be the pharaoh mentioned in the biblical story of the Exodus, although historical evidence for this is limited. After his death, Ramesses II was buried in the Valley of the Kings, and his mummy is one of the best-preserved pharaonic mummies ever discovered. Ramesses II's long and prosperous reign left an enduring mark on Egypt's history, earning him the epithet "the Great."

The stele claims a victory over various enemies, including the Israelites.
          <br>Merneptah also undertook building projects, including the construction of a palace in Memphis, the restoration of temples, and the completion of monuments initiated by his father. His mortuary temple in Thebes, known as the Merneptah Mortuary Temple, is one of the structures attributed to him.

His reign is considered one of the more enigmatic periods in ancient Egyptian history. Amenmesse's precise relationship to the royal family and the circumstances of his rule remain uncertain.
          <br>It is believed that Amenmesse seized the throne after the death of Merneptah, possibly in the midst of a succession dispute. Some scholars propose that Amenmesse may have been a half-brother or a distant relative of Merneptah. The uncertainty surrounding his legitimacy is reflected in the conflicting historical accounts, and the exact nature of his rule remains unclear.
          <br>Amenmesse's reign was relatively short, and he is often associated with a period of disorder and political instability. His successor, Seti II, eventually restored stability to the throne. Amenmesse's historical legacy is marked by the challenges and uncertainties surrounding his rule rather than any significant accomplishments or contributions to Egyptian history.

          Seti II, the son of Merneptah, was the fifth pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty, ruling over Egypt from around 1200 to 1194 BCE during the New Kingdom period. His reign followed the brief and somewhat uncertain rule of Amenmesse. Seti II worked to restore stability to the throne and the country after the perceived disorder of the previous period.
          <br>II faced challenges from the remnants of Amenmesse's faction and had to assert his authority to secure the throne. His rule included military campaigns against Libyan invaders, seeking to maintain control over Egypt's borders. Seti II also conducted building projects, including the construction of a temple at Abydos, where he sought to emphasize his legitimacy by associating himself with the accomplishments of his forebears.
          <br>Seti II's reign was relatively short, and he was succeeded by his son, Merneptah Siptah. The political climate during Seti II's rule, marked by succession disputes and regional challenges, reflects the declining power of the New Kingdom and the increasing instability that would characterize the subsequent Third Intermediate Period in ancient Egyptian history.

          Merneptah Siptah, often simply referred to as Siptah, was the sixth pharaoh of the 19th Dynasty and ruled over ancient Egypt from approximately 1194 to 1188 BCE during the New Kingdom period. Siptah's reign followed that of Seti II, and his ascent to the throne is somewhat obscure.
          <br>Siptah likely had a physical disability, and his reign was likely influenced by powerful figures at court, notably his regent and eventual successor, Tawosret. Siptah's rule faced internal challenges, including political intrigues and rival factions within the royal court.
          <br>During his reign, Siptah initiated some construction projects, including additions to the temple at Karnak. However, the political unrest persisted, and it continued into the subsequent reign of Queen Tawosret, who eventually assumed the throne after Siptah's death.
          <br>Siptah's rule is marked by its brevity, political complexities, and the circumstances that paved the way for the following period in Egyptian history known as the Twentieth Dynasty. The events during his reign foreshadowed the decline of the New Kingdom and the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period.

          Tausret, also known as Twosret or Tawosret, was a queen and the last known ruler of the 19th Dynasty of ancient Egypt. She is thought to have reigned from approximately 1188 to 1186 BCE. Tausret is a significant historical figure because she assumed the throne after the death of her predecessor, Siptah, marking the end of the New Kingdom.
          <br>Tausret was initially the wife of Seti II and, upon his death, assumed the title of Pharaoh. Her reign faced challenges, including internal conflicts and external pressures. She struggled to assert her authority, and during her rule, a powerful official named Bay played a prominent role as a regent.
          <br>Tausret's reign was relatively short and marked by political instability. Eventually, Setnakhte, a military leader, seized power, bringing an end to Tausret's rule. Setnakhte established the 20th Dynasty, and his son, Ramesses III, would go on to become one of the last great pharaohs of the New Kingdom.
          <br>Tausret's historical legacy is notable for being one of the few instances of a woman assuming the full kingship in ancient Egypt, but her reign and its aftermath are also indicative of the declining power and stability of the New Kingdom.

          Setnakhte, also spelled Setnakht, was the founder of the 20th Dynasty and the father of Ramesses III. He ruled over ancient Egypt from around 1186 to 1184 BCE during the turbulent period that marked the transition from the New Kingdom to the Third Intermediate Period.
          <br>Setnakhte's rise to power was not straightforward, as he came from a military background. He seized the throne after a time of political instability that included the brief reign of Tausret and the end of the 19th Dynasty. Setnakhte is often considered to have played a role in restoring order and stability to the kingdom.
          <br>Despite the brevity of his reign, Setnakhte undertook some construction projects, and he is mentioned in the historical records as a ruler who sought to reaffirm the authority of the central government.

          <br>Ramesses III's reign faced significant challenges, including invasions by the Sea Peoples, a coalition of different groups who attacked the eastern Mediterranean and the coastal regions of the Near East. Ramesses III successfully repelled these invasions and is credited with securing Egypt's borders. He documented these victories in the Medinet Habu reliefs, providing valuable historical insights into the events of his time.
          <br>In addition to his military achievements, Ramesses III contributed to the construction of temples and monuments, including the completion of the Temple of Karnak. He also commissioned the construction of his mortuary temple at Medinet Habu, which is one of the best-preserved temples in Egypt.
          <br>Towards the end of his reign, Ramesses III faced internal challenges, including conspiracies and attempts on his life. A plot known as the Harem Conspiracy sought to place a rival on the throne, but the pharaoh's security measures thwarted the conspiracy. Ramesses III's death is shrouded in mystery, and there are theories suggesting that he might have been a victim of an assassination.
          <br>Despite the challenges and uncertainties surrounding the end of his reign, Ramesses III left a lasting impact on Egypt, both in terms of military successes and architectural accomplishments. His rule marked the closing chapter of the New Kingdom and the beginning of the decline that would characterize the subsequent Third Intermediate Period.

          <br>During Ramesses IV's rule, Egypt faced economic challenges, including the diminishing resources of the state.

          <br>Following Ramesses X, the decline of the New Kingdom continued with the rule of subsequent pharaohs such as Ramesses XI. The end of the 20th Dynasty marked the close of the New Kingdom, and the subsequent Third Intermediate Period saw significant political changes, including the fragmentation of central authority, foreign invasions, and shifts in the power dynamics of ancient Egypt. This period laid the groundwork for the later reunification of Egypt under the rule of the first pharaoh of the 21st Dynasty, Smendes.

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
          Ramesses XI, the tenth and last pharaoh of the 20th Dynasty, ruled over ancient Egypt during a tumultuous period from approximately 1078 to 1070 BCE, marking the end of the New Kingdom. His reign faced significant challenges, including internal strife, economic troubles, and the weakening of central authority.
          <br>During Ramesses XI's rule, the authority of the pharaohs continued to decline, and the country experienced increased fragmentation. The High Priests of Amun, particularly Herihor and later Piankh, gained significant power and influence, essentially functioning as de facto rulers in Thebes.
          <br>The declining power of the central government and the division of authority between the pharaoh and the High Priests are evident in the so-called "Great Harris Papyrus," which details the distribution of land and privileges among the various priests and officials.
          <br>The end of Ramesses XI's reign marked the conclusion of the New Kingdom and the beginning of the subsequent Third Intermediate Period, characterized by political fragmentation, invasions, and significant changes in the socio-political landscape of ancient Egypt. The era saw the rise of regional rulers and the establishment of the Twenty-First Dynasty, marking the start of a new chapter in Egyptian history.
