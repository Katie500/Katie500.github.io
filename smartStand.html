    </ul>
  <h5>Working Principle </h5>
  <p>The device uses a laptop webcam, coupled with a Teachable Machine 
    model, to detect the user's position in the kitchen. Based on the 
    user's location, it calculates the angle at which the phone/tablet 
    should be rotated for optimal viewing. The stepper motor then 
    precisely rotates the stand to the calculated angle. The servo motors 
    are used to adjust the tilt for better viewing angles, ensuring the 
    screen is always perfectly aligned with the user's line of sight. </p>

  <h5>User Interaction </h5>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Set Up:</b> The user places their phone/tablet on the SmartStand and starts the accompanying software on their laptop. </li>
    <li><b>Automatic Detection:</b> As the user moves around the kitchen, the laptop's webcam, in conjunction with the Teachable Machine model, detects their position.</li>
    <li><b>Dynamic Adjustment:</b> The SmartStand adjusts its orientation in real-time, smoothly following the user's movements. </li>
    
  </ol>

    missing a beat. Whether it's following a recipe, catching up on a TV 
    show, or simply staying connected, the SmartStand ensures users can 
    do it all while cooking, without ever losing sight of what's important. 
    </br></br>As we continue to refine and improve the Whirl-i-Cook SmartStand, we 
    stay committed to our mission of blending technology with everyday 
    convenience, making life a little easier, one rotation at a time. </p>
  <h5>Integration of Python Script with Arduino for Whirl-i-Cook SmartStand </h5>
  <p>The Whirl-i-Cook SmartStand is a marvel of modern engineering, 
    seamlessly integrating sophisticated software with precise mechanical 
    control. At the heart of this system lies the synergy between a 
    Python script and an Arduino sketch, working in concert to deliver 
    an unparalleled user experience. </p>

  <h5>Python Script: The Brains Behind the Operation </h5>
  <p>
    The Python script is the central intelligence of the SmartStand. 
    Running on a laptop, it uses the built-in webcam to continually 
    monitor the user's position within the kitchen. The script leverages 
    a Teachable Machine model, a form of machine learning, to 
    intelligently interpret the webcam's visual input. This model has 
    been trained to recognize different positions of the user in the 
    kitchen, labeled from zero to four. </br></br>
    Once the user's position is detected, the script performs a series 
    of calculations to determine the optimal angle at which the stand 
    should be oriented for the user to have the best view of their device. 
    This angle is translated into a specific number of steps that the 
    stepper motor needs to execute to achieve the desired rotation. 
  </br></br>
    The script then sends these instructions to the Arduino board via a 
    serial connection. Each instruction is a command that corresponds to 
    one of the five predefined positions, ensuring that the stand rotates 
    precisely to the angle that aligns the phone or tablet with the user's 
    current position. 
  </p>
  <h5>Arduino Sketch: Translating Instructions into Motion </h5>
  <p>The Arduino sketch is designed to receive and interpret the commands 
    sent by the Python script. It acts as the executor, translating the 
    high-level instructions into physical motion.</br></br>Upon receiving a 
    command, such as "STEP_ZERO" or "STEP_ONE", the Arduino sketch 
    activates the stepper motor. It precisely controls the number of 
    steps the motor takes, corresponding to the specific position 
    indicated by the command. This control is crucial for ensuring the 
    smooth and accurate rotation of the stand, aligning the device with 
    the user. </br></br>The Arduino’s role is pivotal in managing the hardware 
    components of the SmartStand. It regulates the stepper motor's speed 
    and direction, ensuring that the transition from one position to 
    another is both fluid and precise. The Arduino's reliable processing 
    and execution of the Python script's instructions are what make the 
    SmartStand's dynamic adjustments possible. </p>
  <h5>Synchronized Functionality for Enhanced User Experience </h5>
  <p>The combination of the Python script's analytical prowess and the 
    Arduino's mechanical control creates a system that is both intelligent 
    and responsive. This synergy allows the Whirl-i-Cook SmartStand to 
    provide an interactive, user-centric cooking experience. It 
    exemplifies how software and hardware can be harmoniously integrated 
    to create a product that is not only functionally efficient but also 
    intuitive and user-friendly.</br></br>In conclusion, the Python script and 
    the Arduino sketch together form the backbone of the Whirl-i-Cook 
    SmartStand, a device that exemplifies the innovative integration of 
    technology into everyday life, making cooking a more connected and 
    enjoyable experience. </p>

    creativity, collaboration, and innovation. As a team of two, we 
    embarked on this venture with a vision to blend technology seamlessly 
    into the culinary experience. </p>
  <h5>Initial Ideation and Sketching </h5>
  <p>Our design process commenced with an initial ideation phase, where 
    both team members, Simon and Katie, sketched out 10 rough design 
    concepts each. This phase resulted in a diverse array of 20 
    preliminary designs, each presenting a unique approach to integrating 
    technology into the kitchen. </p>
  <h5>Concept Selection and Development </h5>
  <p>Among the plethora of ideas, Katie's concept of a track device, 
    designed to ensure the user could always view their phone screen 
    while cooking, stood out. This idea was not only practical in 
    addressing a common kitchen challenge but also presented an 
    intriguing engineering challenge.</br></br>The concept envisioned a smart 
    device that would dynamically adjust the position of a phone or 
    tablet, allowing users to effortlessly follow recipes or enjoy 
    entertainment while engaged in culinary tasks. The implementation 
    required a blend of motion tracking, automated mechanical adjustment, 
    and user-friendly design. </br></br> A refined storyboard was sketched and 
    a stop-motion video of the problem we were solving solidified the 
    intended use of the device. </p>
  <h5>Decision and Further Development </h5>
  <p>After thorough consideration and discussion, we unanimously decided 
    to proceed with the development of Katie's track device concept. 
    This decision was bolstered by the potential we saw in its utility 
    and the engaging challenge it posed in terms of implementation. 
  </br></br>We then created a detailed storyboard, outlining the user's 
  journey with the SmartStand, from setting up the device to experiencing 
  its dynamic adjustments during cooking. This storyboard helped us 
  visualize the user experience and refine the design further. 
  </p>
  <h5>Feedback and Iteration </h5>
  <p>Presenting our concept and preliminary designs in a class setting, 
    we gathered valuable feedback from peers and instructors. This 
    feedback provided us with critical insights, which we incorporated 
    into subsequent design iterations, further polishing the concept. </p>
  <h5>Conclusion </h5>
  <p>The design process of the Whirl-i-Cook SmartStand was a testament 
    to the power of collaborative ideation, iterative design, and 
    user-centric development. From rough sketches to a refined, 
    innovative product, our journey was marked by a steadfast commitment 
    to creating a device that would not only simplify but also enhance 
    the cooking experience. </p>
