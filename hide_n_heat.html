  <h5>Overview</h5>
  <p>Our primary goal for this project was to design and implement an engaging interactive
    application tailored specifically for young children. In pursuit of this objective, we designed a
    unique variation of the classic hide and seek game, adding an exciting twist to the traditional
    format of the game. Our application not only serves as a source of endless amusement, but it
    also allows children to enhance their cognitive skills, problem-solving abilities, and social
    interactions. We firmly believe that our application fosters both enjoyment and learning in a
    single, captivating experience.</p>
  <h5>Gameplay</h5>
  <p>The game begins with one player taking on the role of the game creator, who establishes the
    game group and sets the game's duration, signaling when it will conclude. Players joining the
    game are prompted to enter their names and are assigned unique avatars. The game then
    randomly designates one player as the seeker. Once the setup is complete, the game creator
    initiates the game. Hiders accumulate points as long as they remain uncaught by the seeker.
    When a seeker successfully finds a hider, they can click on the hider's avatar on their device,
    marking them as captured, and the hider's avatar disappears from everyone's screens.
    Throughout the game, seekers have the option to request hints about a hider's location, at the
    cost of losing some of their score. These hints last for only a few seconds and mimic the classic
    "hot and cold" tag, with the screen displaying "hot" as the seeker approaches the hider and
    "cold" as they move away. Additionally, hiders can taunt the seeker to gain more points by
    triggering a loud noise on their device, potentially revealing their position. If all the hiders are
    discovered, the seeker is declared as the winner. However, if the game timer expires before all
    hiders are found or the seeker gives up, the hiders that haven’t been caught are announced as
    the winners. When the game ends, a leaderboard showcasing the players’ scores is displayed.</p>
  <h5>Initial 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>Each team member was asked to sketch out 10 ideas that they believe could be suitable for an
    innovative and engaging application.</p>
  <h5>Refined 10 Sketches</h5>
  <p>After agreeing that the “Hide ‘n Heat” idea had the most prospect for innovation and success,
    each team member created 10 refined sketches that matched their vision of the game. We then
    discussed all the designs, and decided on the game layout and the feasible features that could
    be implemented given our short timeline.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Players can choose the duration of the game.</li>
    <li>Hider is hiding while the seeker looks for him.</li>
    <li>One player can create the game and the remaining players request to join his game.</li>
    <li>Hot and cold hint shows for a few seconds</li>
    <li>Screen shows “Hotter” when the seeker approaches the hider, and shows “Colder” when
      the seeker moves away from the hider.</li>
    <li>Seeker loses points if they choose to use the “Hot and Cold” hint</li>
    <li>When a seeker captures a hider, the captured hider has the option to become a seeker or just wait till the game is over.</li>
    <li>Throughout the game, the hider is given mini challenges that they may or may not complete according to their desire. If completed, they earn more points.</li>
    <li>Hiders can make a loud noise using their phone to taunt the seeker and earn more points.</li>
    <li>Hiders can switch on their flashlight to taunt the seeker and earn more points.</li>
  </ol>
  

  <h5>What makes the game special?</h5>
  <p>What sets this hide and seek game apart and makes it truly special for kids is the seamless
    fusion of technology, strategy, and excitement. Unlike traditional hide and seek, this digital
    version engages young minds with avatars and a dynamic scoring system that adds an element
    of competition and strategy to the mix. Players cleverly choose when to use hints to outsmart
    the seeker or when to taunt to divert their attention. The "hot and cold" hint system not only adds
    a thrilling dimension but also encourages critical thinking and decision-making as players work
    to stay hidden. Moreover, the game's flexibility with set durations and the potential for hiders to
    emerge victorious if the seeker can't find them within the allotted time introduces an element of
    suspense and unpredictability. The leaderboard at the end creates a sense of accomplishment
    and encourages repeated play, as kids strive to improve their scores and master the game's
    intricate strategies. This innovative twist on a classic favorite combines technology, strategy, and
    fun in a way that will captivate young players and keep them coming back for more.</p>
  <h5>Project contribution:</h5>
  <p>Our team's success in this project was the result of a coordinated effort, with each member
    playing a crucial role. When it came to sketching out our initial ideas, each team member
    prepared their own ideas, then we brainstormed, refined, and collaborated to bring our creative
    visions to life. Simon meticulously transformed our sketches into a function and engaging
    application whereas Katie took the lead in creating our impressive portfolio, showcasing our
    work beautifully. Hala and Nayera’s writing skills allowed the team to present informative
    write-ups that effectively communicated the essence of our project. For the demo, Simon, Hala
    and Katie brought the game to life with their enthusiasm and acting skills, and Nayera’a filming
    skills ensured a polished and professional end result. Together, we combined our strengths and
    talents to deliver an innovative and engaging application in a short period of time.</p>
